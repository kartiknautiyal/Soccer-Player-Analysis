# Soccer-Player-Analysis

As part of the academic project at WPI, we worked in a team of 4 on a business problem. This involved data gathering, model development and exploratory data analysis which are key skills for a data scientist. 

We looked at the players in the premier league and their statistics from the 20-21 season. A popularity score was created.

The dataset was downloaded from kaggle and a few more columns were added as felt necessary which are explained in the notebook.
